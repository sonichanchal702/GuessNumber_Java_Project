# 🎯 Guess The Number – Java Console Game

A beginner-friendly **Java mini project** where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.  
This project strengthens **core Java concepts** like loops, conditionals, user input, and basic logic building.

## 🎯 Objective
> Build a console-based Java game that challenges users to guess a number with feedback on every attempt.
- ✅ Generate a random number
- ✅ Take input from the user
- ✅ Provide hints (Too High / Too Low)
- ✅ Track number of attempts
- ✅ Display success message with score

---# 🧠 What I Learned
- 🧮 Logic building and decision-making
- 🔄 Using loops (`while`, `do-while`) and conditionals (`if-else`)
- 🎲 `Random` class for number generation
- ⌨️ `Scanner` class for user input
- 🧹 Code readability and modularization
